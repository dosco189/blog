There are a number of ideas and concepts I've picked up across the internet - from papers and blog posts to YouTube videos and tweetstorms. I've compiled some of my favorite ones below:

* [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail) / some description that is more than one word or a few words, and necessitates moving into the next line.
* [Cities and Ambition](http://paulgraham.com/cities.html)
* [Schopenhauer as educator](https://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/330T/350kPEENietzscheSchopenTable.pdf)
* [The Mundanity of Excellence](https://academics.hamilton.edu/documents/themundanityofexcellence.pdf)
* [Science and the Taboo of psi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw_O9Qiwqew)
