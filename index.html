<p>Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>
<p>This website is somewhere between a blog and a notebook. In it I attempt to capture evolving ideas, notes, bookmarks, really anything that captures my imagination. You can learn more <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">about me here</a>, or check out this blog post. </p>
<p> I’ve made several friends on the internet, so if you’d like to grab a coffee in Toronto or virtually over Zoom, feel free to <a href="mailto:arth@overthinker.in">reach out</a> </p>
