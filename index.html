<p>Hello! This website is somewhere between a blog and a notebook. In it I attempt to capture evolving ideas, notes, and bookmarks that capture my curiosities. You can learn more <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">about me here</a>, check out <a href="/essays/Post-4/">this blog post</a>, or browse some <a href="/links/">links</a> I find interesting. </p><br>

<p>If youâ€™d like to grab a coffee in Toronto or virtually over Zoom, please <a href="mailto:arthgupta7@gmail.com">reach out</a> </p>
