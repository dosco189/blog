I'm glad you felt the need to know more. 

There are three important decisions that have charted the course of my life. Before I tell you what they were and why they mattered - here's a little bit about me. 

I went to a high school that I shouldn't have gone to - it was too expensive, above and beyond what my parents could afford - and was very much reserved for the rich and elite of India. I was neither. I was a middle-class kid who had a lot of potential but no means to realize it.

The journey from adolescence to adulthood began earlier for me - as I decided to take up IB instead of the classical Indian Curriculum during 10th grade. I was 16 years old at the time. This was a consequential decision because it a) shut down my options for higher education in India, and b) meant that I had to rely on some type of scholarship to fund college. I applied to the top schools in the US, with a classical application - debate captain, internal wins, published papers and all that. I did not get aid and was rejected from the schools I applied to. 

Then I made the second consequential decision of my life - to take a gap year.
