My name is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A5#:~:text=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A5%20%E2%80%A2%20(arth)%20m%20(,This%20word%20has%20several%20meanings.">Arth</a> - which in Sanskrit means “meaning” - fitting for Philosophy grad. 

I spent my adolescence at a [boarding school](https://www.doonschool.com/) in India and took a year off before college during which I worked [as a journalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1L023Q-Wu8), [competed in olympiads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Philosophy_Olympiad), and backpacked through Europe. 

I studied philosophy and economics at UBC, and spent time outside the classroom working for a financial media company, taking courses for other people, and leading product at an AI startup. I’m curious about many things - from art and science to existentialism and credit default swaps.

Most recently, I spent my time at [Gemic](https://gemic.com/) - a growth strategy firm where I got to ask and answer interesting questions about people, products, and markets. If economics suggests that people maximize “utility”, my experience at Gemic has taught me that they define it very differently. You can learn more about my work [here](https://work.arthgupta.com/). 

Presently, I work with select clients on brand, strategy, and GTM projects. 

I'm based out of Toronto, but you can find me [online](https://x.com/arthgupta).

### this website

This website is an experiment - I built it from scratch using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with custom styling to learn basic programming and front-end web-development.

I intend to use this space as a notebook, documenting my learnings about ideas I find interesting. The contents are fallible - so I welcome your feedback.

It should be obvious but for legal reasons I will explicitly state:
