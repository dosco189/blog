These are some of the words that I've come to enjoy.

<blockquote>
        <p>When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things. I just want to get at it slowly, but carefully and thoroughly, with the same attitude I remember was present just before I found that sheared pin. It was that attitude that found it, nothing else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All that is gold does not glitter, <br>
Not all those who wander are lost;<br>
The old that is strong does not wither,<br>
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br>
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring;<br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
The crownless again shall be king.</p>

<blockquote>
        It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men!
