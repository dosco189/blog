<p>These are some of the better ideas I have come to encounter in my life. </p>

        <p> About suffering they were never wrong,<br>
                The old Masters: how well they understood<br>
                Its human position: how it takes place<br>
                While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully 
                along;<br>
                How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting<br>
                For the miraculous birth, there always must be<br>
                Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating<br>
                On a pond at the edge of the wood:<br>
                They never forgot<br>
                That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course<br>
                Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot<br>
                Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse<br>
                Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.</p>
        <p>In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away<br>
        Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may<br>
        Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,<br>
        But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone<br>
        As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green<br>
        Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen<br>
        Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,<br>
        Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.</p>

<div class="quote">
        <p>Masons, when they start upon a building,<br>
Are careful to test out the scaffolding;<br>

Make sure that planks won’t slip at busy points,<br>
Secure all ladders, tighten bolted joints.<br>

And yet all this comes down when the job’s done<br>
Showing off walls of sure and solid stone.<br>

So if, my dear, there sometimes seem to be<br>
Old bridges breaking between you and me<br>

Never fear. We may let the scaffolds fall<br>
Confident that we have built our wall.<br>

        <p>We look back upon our life only as on a thing of broken pieces, because our misses and failures are always the first to strike us, and outweigh in our imagination what we have done, and attained.</p>
