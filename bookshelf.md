Currently Reading: [The Measure of Reality, Alfred W. Crosby](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-Reality-Quantification-Western-1250-1600/dp/0521639905)

Inspired by [several](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf) [internet]  [bookshelfs], this is a list of books in my library. 

Knowledge takes many forms, each essential in its own right. Formal knowledge - acquired through books, papers, blogs and other media - provides legible details in the path of inquiry. But visceral knowledge - acquired through direct contact with reality, often at the cost of intellectual, emotional, or physical discomfort – provides the illegible details. I strongly believe in accumulating both. I believe that no question is conclusively settled - and my library represents the questions I have asked and arrived at AN answer for.

Inspired by Taleb's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilibrary">antilibrary</a>, several books remain unfinished and are savored over time.

At some point in the future I'll work on an ML project to extract book titles from images. May the image be worth a thousand words (for now).
