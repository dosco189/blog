These are some of the books I have read or intend to read at some point in the future. This collection is closer to an antilibrary than it is to a library. What is unread outnumbers what is read, as what is unknown presently outweighs what is known. 

They reflect some of my intellectual interests - which range from philosophy and finance to poetry and history. I think a good book is one that escapes categorization and is “n of 1”. Usually it is also one that reframes, sharpens, or defines ideas. 

At some point I’ll try to build a project to extract titles from the image and list them here as text.
