<p>“Of the many ideals which in youth gave life a meaning and radiance missing from the chilly perspectives of middle age, one at least has remained with me as bright and satisfying as ever before - the shameless worship of heroes. In an age that would level everything and reverence nothing, I take my stand with Victorian Carlyle, and light my candles, like Mirandola before Plato’s image, at the shrines of great men.”</p>

It is important to think well not for the sake of thinking but for the sake of doing. I believe that there are two kinds of knowledge - intellectual knowledge and visceral knowledge. The former comes from reading and the latter comes from the bitter pain of expereince. 
These are some of the books I have read or intend to read at some point in the future. This collection is closer to an antilibrary than it is to a library. What is unread outnumbers what is read, as what is unknown presently outweighs what is known. 

They reflect some of my intellectual interests - which range from philosophy and finance to poetry and history. I think a good book is one that escapes categorization and is “n of 1”. Usually it is also one that reframes, sharpens, or defines ideas. 

At some point I’ll try to build a project to extract titles from the image and list them here as text.
