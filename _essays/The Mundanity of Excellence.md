Powerful ideas force you to reconceptualize the world - qualitative differentiation is one of them. 

Taken to its extreme - it leads to some unsettling conclusions.

An iconic paper highlighting the essence of the idea is The Mundanity of Excellence - making a case that even at the level of extreme athletic competition - it is qualitative differentiation, and not quantitative differentiation that leads to success. 

But I think the deeper point is that when we witness the final outcomes of things and events - they are reified explanations. The actual ‘process’ is largely illegible. Competition - as a paradigm of thinking is pervasive in our world - it is how we reason through ability, allocate resources, and pool together talent. 

But competition as a paradigm of evaluation is only helpful insofar as every individual competing is oriented towards achieving the same outcomes. In other words, competition is great at measuring potential along dimensions that are a) already defined. Aka you know what winning looks like. 

But creative endeavors - whether art or business - are trying to create something fundamentally new. 

There is no method.

One insight I run into often is that people often don’t use the same words to refer to the same concepts. For instance, car buyers might want their vehicle to be “high performance”, but actually mean:
“Goes 0 to 100 in under 3 seconds” (Performance as speed)
“Does not need maintenance work - e.g. replacing oil/spare parts” (Performance as durability)
“Integrates with my iPhone” (Performance as )
“Looks like a Sedan/Sports Car” (Performance as aesthetics / design)

Looks like they’re not talking about the same things, they’re not even in the same ballpark of concerns about what actually matters to them - the variation ranges from speed and acceleration to aerodynamics. 

A paper I come back to quite often is The Mundanity of Excellence by Daniel F Chambliss. It’s an ethnographic (qualitative) study on what constitutes excellence in olympic swimming. The answer is simple - simple, mundane, qualitative differences. 

For instance, three car buyers might all want their vehicles to be “high performance” but for someone it might mean “goes 0 - 100 in under 3 seconds” while for someone else it might 

The core point of the article is really very simple - excellence is a byproduct of qualitative, not quantitative differentiation. The “best” aren’t doing more of the same thing - they are doing things differently. If it sounds trivial, it’s because it actually is. The discrete components that constitute an activity can be differentiated qualitatively - to the extent that they look like the same thing on the outside but are actually not. 

The strong conclusion of the idea extends well to business and leads to some uncomfortable conclusions

The Mundanity of Excellence: An Ethnographic Report on Stratification and Olympic Swimmers

Olympic sports, and competitive swimming in particular provide an unusually clear opportunity for studying the nature of excellence. “Outstanding performance” in other fields may be less clear - but in sport, success is defined more exactly - by success in competition.

In swimming, stratification exists not only between individuals but also between defined levels of the sport. At the lowest level - you have the country club - operating in the summertime as a loosely run, mildly competitive league - with volunteer and part time coaches. Above that there are teams which represent cities and compete with teams from other cities, then a Junior Nationals (featuring the best under 18), then Senior Nationals, and finally we could speak of the world or the Olympic level competitor. Levels of the sport are distinct from one another. 

Because success in swimming is so definable, and the stratification so relatively unambiguous (so that the athletes progress can be easily chartered) - we can clearly see, by comparing levels and studying individuals as they move between and within these levels what exactly produces excellence. 

Additionally, careers in swimming are short and one can achieve a lot of success in a small amount of time. Rowdy Gaines began the sport when he was 17 years old and jumped from a country club league to a world record in the 100 meter freestyle event in only three years. 

The Research
[update on method]

What does not produce excellence?
Excellence is not a product of “socially deviant” personalities. Those who are excellent are not loners. The best athletes can be more self confident - but that confidence could be an effect of achievement, not the cause of it. 
Excellence does not result from quantitative changes in behavior. E.g. Increase in training time per se is not going to increase your speed. Neither does increased “psyching up” help, nor does moving the arms “faster”. Doing more of the same will not lead you moving up a level. 
Excellence does not result from the special inner quality of the athlete. “Talent” is one common name for this inner quality, sometimes we call it “natural ability”. A loose label for the unexplained variance between cause and effect. These terms are generally used to mystify the essential mundane process of achievement in sports, keeping us away from a realistic analysis of the actual factors creating superlative performance and protecting us from a sense of responsibility for our own outcomes. 

So where does excellence come from?
1. Qualitative Differentiation
Excellence in competitive swimming is achieved through qualitative differentiation from other swimmers, not through quantitative increases in activity. 

Quantitative improvements: increase in the number of some one thing one does. Increasing training from 2 hours to 4 hours is a quantitative improvement. Increasing daily swim length from 5 miles to 7 miles is a quantitative improvement. A swimmer using the same swimming style / stroke, but increasing the number of strokes per minute. 

Simply put, quantitative improvements involve doing more of the same thing. 

Qualitative improvements: changing the nature and character of the thing itself. A qualitative change involves modifying what is actually being done - not simply doing more of it. 

For a swimmer doing the backstroke, a qualitative change might be a change from pulling straight back with the arms, to sculling them outwards to the side, or from lifting oneself up out of the water at the turn, to staying low near the water. 

Eating veggies instead of fats and sugars, entering weaker events vs stronger events, competing regionally instead of competing nationally - are all examples of qualitative changes in behavior. 

Qualitative Improvements involve doing different kinds of things - not more of the same. 
Different levels of the sport are qualitatively distinct. 

Olympic champions don’t just do more of the same thing that summer league simmers do. They are not swimming more hours or moving their arms faster, etc. What makes them faster cannot be quantitatively compared - although quantitative differences do exist. But these differences often pop up after qualitative “jumps” have already been made. 

These discontinuous “jumps” - the fundamental alteration of character of a process - are what create qualitative differentiation. 

Three dimensions of qualitative difference
Technique 
The styles of strokes are dramatically different at different levels of performance. The strokes are different between a “C” breaststroke vs a “AAAA” breaststroke. 

A “C” stroke might involve pulling arms far back beneath, kicking the legs out very wide without bringing them together at the finish, lift herself high out of the water on the turn, fail to take a long pull underwater after the turn and touch at the finish with one hand on her side. 

At elite levels of performance - in olympic swimming there is hardly any splash as swimmers jump into the water. 

Discipline
The best swimmers are more likely to be strict with their training, coming to workouts on time, carefully doing the competitive strokes legally, without violating technical rules etc. They watch what they eat, sleep regular hours etc. The energies are carefully channeled. 

E.g. Diver Greg Louganis - who won two olympic gold medals in 1984 practiced only 3 hours each day - not a long time - divided up into two or three sessions. But, during each session, he tried to do every dive perfectly. Louganis was never sloppy in practice so was never sloppy in meets. 

Attitude 
At the higher levels of competitive swimming - something like an inversion of attitude takes place - the very features of the sport which the C level swimmer finds unpleasant, the top level swimmer enjoys. What others see boring, this person finds meditative - often challenging - and even therapeutic. 

They enjoy hard practices, look forward to difficult competitions, and try to set difficult goals. 

It is incorrect to believe that top athletes suffer great sacrifices to achieve their goals. Often, they don’t see what they are doing as a sacrifice at all. They like it. 

These qualitative differences are what distinguish levels of the sport. They are very noticeable, while the quantitative differences between levels - both in training and in competition may be surprisingly small indeed. 

A small quantitative difference produces an enormous qualitative difference. 

1984 olympics - 100 m freestyle, rowdy gaines finished ahead of second place by .44 seconds - a gap of 8/10 of 1% between Gaines and the 8th palace finisher (Dirk Korthals). 

Stratification in the sport is discrete, not continuous. 

There are significant, qualitative breaks and discontinuities between levels of the sport. These include differences in attitude, discipline, and technique, which lead to small but consistent quantitative differences in speed. 

Some teams are “stuck” at the same level of the sport. Certainly swimmers typically remain with a certain level for most of their careers, maintaining throughout their career the habits with which they began. 

It is not by doing increasing amounts of work that one becomes excellent, but rather by changing the kinds of work that are being done. I.e. Athletes do not simply “work their way up to the top” by accumulating sheer time in the sport. 

Instead, qualitative jumps are usually accomplished through a change in setting - e.g. joining a new team with a new coach, new friends etc who work at a higher level. Without such qualitative jumps, no major improvements take place. 


We find the same phenomenon in other areas of endeavor. Carl von Clauseitz, writer of tej classic 10th century text on military Strategy On War, noted that great generals rise quickly. Especially in wartime, when battlefield performance is the vital need, there is no long period of apprenticeship before one achieves the highest ranks, no tedious “accumulation” of knowledge or skills:

“The most distinguished generals have never risen from the very learned or really erudite class of officers, but have been mostly men who, from the circumstances of their position, could not have attained any amount of knowledge… the only question therefore is, of what kind should these ideas be?”

This is also true in academic life - where no sheer amount of papers given at local conferences “add up to” a Sorokin award winning book or an article in Daedalus. (this is obvious in reading job candidates vitae: far better to see one page that lists a Guggenheim fellowship and a National Book Award than 15 pages of book reviews in the regional association. 

Increased effort does bring increased success - but at higher levels of the sport, virtually everyone is working hard - and effort per se is not the determining factor that it is among lower level athletes, many of whom do not try very hard. 

Quantitative Changes bring success only within levels of the sport. Doing more of the same pays off, but only in very limited, locally visible ways. One can achieve a slight advantage over peers by doing more without changing the quality of what is done. 

Assuming implicitly that stratification in sports is continuous rather than discrete (that the differences are quantitative) we believe that top athletes do unbelievable things. In short, we believe that they must be superhuman. 

This is really several worlds, each with its own patterns of conduct. 
Perhaps the original conception of a swimming world is important. “Top” of the sport is a different level than the “local” levels of the sport - but the very conception of a single swimming world is inaccurate - it assumes everyone is trying to climb the same ladder -  aiming otwards the same goals and sharing the same values. But they aren’t. Some want gold medals, some want to make the team, some want to exercise or have fun with friends, some are trying to escape parents etc. 

The definition of top is what people define to be the top. 


This violates our notion of “common sense” . Fast swimmes take aas given that faster is better - instead of say, the more beautiful the better, or that parental involvement is better, or what ‘well rounded’ children are better. The very terminology of “top” and “level” then reieifies the current ranking system. 

Such reification is not only analytically suspect - it is also empirically incorrect. When children say “I want to win the Olympics” - they are sharing fantasies or announcing plans. And fantasies are more often enjoyed in their unreality than in their fulfillment. 

So swimming should be conceived not as a single world but multiple worlds (and changing worlds is a major step towards excellence) - a horizontal rather than a vertical differentiation of the sport. 

Each such world has its own distinctive types of powerful people and dominant athletes, and being prominent in one world is no guarantee of being prominent in another. 

Horizontal differentiation rather than vertical differentiation may be refuted by the fact that “moving Up” is very difficult but “moving down” is apparently easy - as if a sort of gravity is obtained. We know that it takes to learn all those skills - pick up the techniques, develop the stamina, change the attitudes, practice the discipline etc. This difficulty seems to suggest an asymmetry to these worlds. 

The physical work as well as the psychological readjustments that are required are significant. This difficulty suggests that there is an asymmetry to these worlds. Less obvious is the “sliding back down”. 

Techniques once learned and habitualized don't deteriorate overnight - 

In 1972 a 16 year old named Sandra Nielson - won three gold medals in the Munich Olympics in swimming. In 1984, just after turning 29, she entered the National Long Course Championships, placed in the finals, and swam faster than she had 12 years earlier-and with far less training! At that point she had been away from competition for 10 years.

Still - there seem to be permanent or at least persistent effects of hard training - attitudes of competitiveness and strategies for racing once learned are rarely forgotten. And finally - perhaps as significantly - the social pressures are stringy against “going back” to a lower level of competition. Hotshots are not welcome in the country club cleagues while they are hotshots, and if their skills do begin to deteriorate, embarrassment will more likely lead one simply to quit the sport rather than to continue. This may be roughly akin to the older professor who rather than attempt to compete with younger colleagues in a fast moving field - begins to fill his time with more committee meetings. 

All this to say that “top” performers are better seen as different than as better. 

Clausewitz pointed out that in comparing the highest commanders in Napoleans army with a colonel: There are Field Marshals who would not have shone at the head of a cavalry regiment, and vice versa. 

i.e. Some people don’t even begin to shine unless they reach the higher levels. The differences are discrete, not continuous. 

2. Why “Talent” does not lead to excellence

Athletic excellence is widely attainable, if usually unsought. 

Great athletes, we believe seem to be born with a special gift - almost this :thing” inside of them, denied to the rest of us - perhaps physical, genetic, psychological or physiological. Some have “it” and others don’t. 

We believe that it is talent, conceived as a substance behind the surface reality of performance, which finally distinguishes the best among our athletes. 

But talent as an explanation fails on conceptual grounds - it mystifies excellence rather than explaining it. 

At a conceptual level, talent as an explanation for excellence fails on three accounts:
Factors other than talent explain athletic success more precisely

This happens when you observe a performance “monotheticall” - at a single glance, all at once. When you see olympic athletes once every four years - reifying their abilities as talent - you haven’t observed the other factors across different levels of performance - access to a pool, height, weight, athletic ability - etc. 

When you watch singular performances you believe excellence is a thing inside of them which they periodically reveal to us. 

“Now, no one can see in an artist’s work how it evolved: that is its advantage, for whenever we can see the evolution, we grow somewhat cooler. The complete art of representation wards off all thought of its solution: it tyrannizes as present perfection.” - Nietzsche, 1984, page 111)

Talent is indistinguishable from its effects. One cannot see it until after its effects have become obvious. 

It takes years to appear gifted. 
Only after observation do we ascribe the fact that their ability existed all along - we were just unaware of it until late. 

Kalinowski - perhaps there is no such thing as “talent”, the only thing is the outstanding performance itself. But recurring evidence suggests a different take. You see success and immediately infer a cause behind it - a cause for which there is no evidence of success other than the success itself. 

The independent independent and the dependent variables cannot be measured separately. 

The “amount” of talent needed for athletic success seems to be strikingly low.

An entire generation of literature exists of someone with low athletic ability ‘making it’ to the top through diligence and practice. 

And if the basic level of talent needed is so universally available - perhaps the very concept of talent itself - no longer differentiating among performers - is better discarded altogether. It simply doesn't explain the difference in outcomes. 

Talent provides a quick and spurious “explanation” of athletic success. It satisfies the casual curiosities without requiring an empirical analysis or critical question of our tacit assumptions about athletes. It’s the layman’s term for “unexplained variance”. 

What we call talent is no more than the projected reification of a thing done. - Hands placed correctly in the water, turns crisply executed, a head held high rather than low in the water. 

“What people would like is that a coward or a hero be born that way”. - Sartre. 

“To call someone divine means ‘Here we do not have to compete’”.

Talent as an explanation protects us by degrading the very achievements that it pretends to elevate. Magically separating us from those people who are great athletes, ensuring that we are incomparable to them, and relieving those of us who are not excellent of responsibility for our own condition.

In the mystified notion of talent, the un-analyzed pseudo-explanation of outstanding performance, we codify our own deep psychological resistance to the simple reality of the world, to the overwhelming mundanity of excellence. 
The Mundanity of Excellence
“People don’t know how ordinary success is” Mary T Meagher, winner of 3 olympic gold medals in the LA olympics. 

The insight applies to other fields of endeavour as well - business, politics, including academics. 

Excellence is mundane
Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or a activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into hait and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. There is nothing extraordinary or superhuman in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and correct, and all together, produce excellence. 

The “little things” really do count. 

Looking at the subtleties as any expert would do - it’s not just that the little things are important - the little things are the only things. 

Peter Drucker calls these “practices” - that success in business is not magical but rather a faithful execution of particular practices that leads to success in business. 


When Mary Meagher was 13 years old she qualified for the national championships, she dided to try to break the world record in the 200 m butterfly race. She made two immediate qualitative changes in her routine: first, she began coming on time to all practices. She recalls now, years later, being picked up at school by her mother and driving through the streets of louisville, desperately trying to make it to the pool on time. The first change was that she became a lot more disciplined - and start treating every minute of practice seriously - because it counted. And second - she started executing every stroke in practice to the professional and competitive standards (most swimmers don’t do this - executing their turns casually in practice). 

Within a year she broke the record. 

An area ripe for research in organizational studies - is to what extent do mundane considerations lead to the success or failure of organizations, let alone individuals? A willingness to spend ten minutes a year writing a christmas card can maintain an old friendship for decades. 

A faulty telephone system - which cuts off one quarter or even one tenth of all incoming calls can ruin a travel agency or mail order house. 
A president of a company simply walking around the plant  once in a while, talking with the workers can dramatically improve an organization’s morale - and its products. A secretary, that artheypal manager of mundane work can make or destriy an executive - even an entire division. 

The conclusion: the simple doing of certain small tasks can generate huge results. Excellence is mundane. 

Motivation is mundane, too
But even given the long-term goals of a swimmer - the daily satisfactions need to be there. The mundane social rewards really are crucial. By comparison, the big, dramatic motivations - winning an olympic, setting a world record - seem to be ineffective unless translate into shorter term tasks. 

The big, dramatic, motivations - winning an olympic gold metal, setting a world record - seem to be inefective unless translated into shorter term tasks. Rocky may inspire you for a day or a week - but the inspiration will wear off once one is confronted with the day to day reality of climbing out of bed to go and jump in cold water. 

On the other hand, if the day to day reality itself is fun, rewarding, and challenging, if the water is nice and friends are supportive, the longer term goals may well be achieved almost in spite of themselves. 

Mary Meagher “I have never looked beyond the next year - I never looked beyond the next level”. 

Most olympic swimmers got there by dividing the work into achievable steps - no one of which was too big. Working on a better start this week, polishing up their backstroke next week, focusing on better sleep habits, etc. Karl Weick calls these “small wins” - the very definable, minor achievements which can be rather easily done but which produce significant effects, not the least of which is the confidence to attempt another such “small win”. 

Weick: A small win is a concrete, complete, implemented outcome of moderate importance. By itself, one small win may seem unimportant. A series of wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower resistance to subsequent proposals. Small wins are controllable opportunities that produce visible results. 

Steve Lundquist made it a habit of never losing - every day. He won everyday in practice, so he won in the competitions. Competition when the day arrived for a meet, was not a shock to him, nothing at all out of the ordinary. 

In the pursuit of excellence, maintaining mundanity is the key psychological challenge. 

In common parlance, “winner’s don’t choke”. Faced with what seems to be a tremendous challenge or a strongly unusual event, the better athletes take it as normal, manageable situation (“It’s just another swim meet”). 

Standard rituals (such as the warup, the psych, the visualization of the race, the takeing off of sweats, and the like_ to make it as normal an event as possible. 

If each day is approached with a seriousness of purpose, then the big meet will not come as a shock. The athlete will believe “i belong here, this is my world” - and not be paralized by fear or self-consciousness. The task then is to have training closely approximate competition conditions. 

Maintaining Mundanity in Other Professions
An actor in a play practicing with “competition intensity” during dress rehearsals. 
Public Speakers who know that the very best speeches are delivered in the belief that “the world will little note nor long remember what we say here”
Personal example of Michael - a guy who spent 12 years in graduate school who was unable to finish his thesis because he could not maintain the sense of mundanity - that it is just another piece of work. 

The mundanity of excellence is typically unrecognized. Usually we see great athletes only after they have become great. 

Even when seen close up - this mundanity is not often believed - every week at the national champion nadadores team practiced  the visiting coaches would come to the deck to see the swimmers - but later would start looking at the mountains and chilling. “They all have come to Mecca, and see what we do,” coach Mark Schubert said, “They think we have some big secret”. 

But of course, there is no secret; there is only the doing of all those little things, each one done correctly, time and again, until excellence in every detail becomes a firmly ingrained habit, an ordinary part of one’s everyday life. 

Conclusions:
Excellence is a qualitative phenomenon - doing more does not equal doing better. High performers focus on qualitative, not quantitative improvements, which produce significant changes in level of achievement: different levels of achievement really are distinct, and in fact reflect vastly different habits, values, and goals. 
Talent is a useless concept - varying conceptions of natural ability ten to mystify excellence, treating it as the inherent possession of a few, they mask the concrete actions that create outstanding performance. These conceptions perpetuate the se sense of innate psychological differences between high performers and other people
Excellence is mundane. It is accomplished through the doing of actions, ordinary in themselves, performed consistently and carefully, habitualized, compounded together, added up over time. 
Achieving “high performance” is neither unmanageable nor is it terribly difficult. 
Every time a decision comes up - the qualitatively “correct” choice will be made. The action 0 in itself is nothing special - the care and consistency with which it is made is. 

—
Reconceptualizing talent in ways that make it accessible to study. He has attempted to shift the conceptual underpinnings of talent from the realm of internal “states and traits” to the realm of external practices and behaviors - and has done so in a way that reveals talent essentially to be a ‘useless concept’. 

Talent is deconstructed so that access can be deregulated. It’s chambliss the coach and quintessential American - excellence is winning; talent can be operationalized; virtually all people who really apply themselves can be winners; talent is useless as a concept. 

In the process of deconstruction we learn that strata are mainly a function of mundane application. 

Excellence is produced in other words, when differences of kind are treated within a culture (of swimming) as differences in degree.

The significant difference between criteria in games and in nongame fields is that in the latter, criteria of worth often are constituted through reference to the activities they are merely meant to measure.
