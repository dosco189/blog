This is a template showing how to implement footnotes in your essays for more scientific and academic writing.

## Basic Footnote Examples
Here's a simple statement that needs a citation[^1]. You can also reference multiple sources in one footnote[^2].

Sometimes you want to add explanatory notes that don't break the flow of reading[^3]. This is particularly useful for technical definitions or additional context.

There's a third sentence.

Here is a fourth.

## Advanced Footnote Usage
### Multiple References
You can reference the same footnote multiple times[^4]. Later in the text, you might want to reference it again[^4] without creating a new footnote.

### Complex Citations
For academic papers, you might want more detailed citations[^5]. This allows for proper attribution while maintaining readability.

### Explanatory Footnotes
Sometimes footnotes contain substantial additional information[^6] that would otherwise interrupt the main argument.

## Inline vs Reference Style
You can also use inline footnotes^[This is an inline footnote that appears directly in the text] for shorter comments.

For longer explanations, reference-style footnotes work better[^7].

## Technical Implementation
The footnotes below will appear at the bottom of the page, and with the right CSS, will also show as hover tooltips.

[^3]: This is what academics call a "gloss" - additional information that clarifies or expands on the main text without derailing the primary argument.

[^5]: For a comprehensive analysis of competitive dynamics in markets, see Porter, Michael E. *Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors*. Free Press, 1980; Christensen, Clayton M. *The Innovator's Dilemma*. Harvard Business Review Press, 1997; and Thiel, Peter. *Zero to One*. Crown Business, 2014, pp. 34-58.

[^6]: The concept of "illegible excellence" draws from James C. Scott's work on legibility in *Seeing Like a State* (Yale University Press, 1998), where he argues that state simplifications often miss the complex, local knowledge that makes systems actually work. In the context of personal excellence, this suggests that measurable metrics often fail to capture the qualitative processes that produce superior performance.

[^7]: Reference-style footnotes are preferred in academic writing because they: (1) don't interrupt the visual flow of the main text, (2) allow for more detailed citations, (3) can be easily reordered if the text is revised, and (4) provide a clear separation between main argument and supporting evidence.
