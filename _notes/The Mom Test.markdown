---

_These are my notes from the book "The Mom Test". I read it after having worked in research for a while, and found it a concise guide to getting the most out of user/customer conversations. Much of what we can learn about a person depends on the questions we ask. Stay curious!_

**Introduction**

* Learning is an exercise in **Excavation** = mining for what is there but buried. The truth is down there, but is fragile. 
* Questions can bias the respondent. 
* Goals and Questions are tools. 
* Bad customer conversations give you **false signals**. False signals waste cash and time of the enterprise. 
* Worst thing that can happen to a startup is no one cares if it disappears. 

**Chapter 1: The Mom Test**

* Don’t ask if your business is a good idea. 
* The world (and your customers) do not _owe_ you the truth about the problem. 
* Interviews done wrong are worse than interviews not done at all - they give you false signals (false positives). Like convincing a drunk they’re sober - not an improvement. 
* Measure of a useful conversation 
    * Whether we receive concrete facts about **customers’ life _and_ worldviews**.  
* We find out what people care about my never mentioning what we’re doing. Talk about them and their lives. 
* **People will lie to you if they think that’s what you want to hear.**
* Customers own the problem. We own the solution. 

**Chapter 2: Avoiding Bad Data**

* Bad data gives **false negatives** - thinking the idea is dead when it is not, and **false positives** - thinking the idea is correct when it isn’t. 
* Types of bad data
    * Compliments
    * Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, the future)
    * Ideas
* Deflect compliments - you want facts and commitments. 
    * _That’s cool, I love it!_
    * _How are you dealing with this at the moment?_
    * _Oh it’s not that big of a deal! We kind of ignore it_
* Symptoms/Signs for poor data
    * In the meeting
        * _Thanks!_
        * _I’m glad you like it_
    * Back at the office
        * _That meeting went really well_
        * _We’re getting a lot of positive feedback_
        * _Everybody I’ve talked to loves the idea_
* Typology of Fluff:
    * Generic claims (_I usually, I always, I never_)
    * Future tense promises (_I would, I will_)
    * Hypothetical maybes (_I might, I could_)
    * Questions that start with “would you ever”
* Differentiate between complainers and customers.
* **Dig for emotional signals to understand where they’re coming from.** 

**Chapter 3: Asking Important Questions**

* **Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking at least one question which has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business.**
* Worst thing one can do is ignore the bad news while searching for some tiny grain of validation to celebrate. You want the truth. Not a gold star. 
* Don’t zoom in too quickly. Their number 1 problem in X (say fitness) could still be an unimportant one. 
* Good idea to ask for major annoyances, costs, or joys.
* Anchor, and Dig. 
* Filter market risk vs product risk - e.g. Video games are 100% pure product risk. 
    * If you have heavy product risk - conversations alone will not be enough to validate your idea. 
* Prepare a list of **3 most important things you want to learn from any given type of person (customer, investor, industry expert, key hire)**.
  * _Know your biggest risk, goal orientation at any given point in time._

**Chapter 4: Keeping it Casual**

* Steve Blank’s approach takes 3 separate meetings to “develop” customers.
   1. About the customer and the problem
   2. About your solution 
   3. To sell the product (close)
* The most precious resource in a startup is its **founder's time**. 
    * Constantly ask if you’re working on the right problem. 
* You want signals of informality. Keeping the conversation “light” while nudging it in a useful direction is the key. 
* **Have a clear next step at the end of the conversation.**

**Chapter 5: Commitment and Advancement**

* Always move the conversation to the next step. By giving them a clear chance to **commit or reject** you get out of the startup friendzone to find real leads. 
* Symptoms of the startups friendzone (dead leads)
    * Pipeline of zombie leads
    * Product meetings that end with a compliment
    * Product meetings that end with no clear next steps
    * Meetings which “went well”
    * They haven’t given anything of value. 
* **Every meeting either succeeds or fails.**
    * If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless. 
* Commitments can be cash, but they don’t have to be.
* **Three currencies of a conversation: time, reputation risk, and cash.**
    * Time Commitments
        * Clear next meetings with known goals 
        * Sitting down to give feedback on wireframes
        * Using a trial of the product for a non-trivial period 
    * Reputational Risk Commitments
        * Intro to peers or team
        * Intro to a decision maker (boss, spouse, lawyer)
        * Giving a public testimonial or case study
    * Financial commitments
        * Letter of intent (non-legal but gentlemanly agreement to purchase)
        * Pre-order
        * Deposit
* Signs of bad meetings
    * _That’s so cool I love it!_ **>** just a compliment, does not signal commitment or interest. 
    * _Looks great, let me  know when it launches_ **>** stalling tactic
    * _There are a couple of people I can introduce you to when you’re ready_ **>** could be better, they might be flexing - get more details and force timelines. 
* Signs of good meetings
    * _Cool. What are the next steps?_ **>** **Caveat - even clear next steps can be a lie. Everything can be a lie.**
    * _When can we start the trial?_ **>** maybe good. 
    * _Can I buy the prototype?_ **GREAT**
    * _When can you come back and talk to the rest of the team?_ **>** good but for consumer can be murkier since the purchase journey is different.
* Key takeaways:
    * When someone **isn't** too emotional about what you’re doing, they are unlikely to end up being one of the crazy first customers. 
    * Whenever **you see deep emotion**, do your utmost to keep that person close. 
* In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is a side effect. 

**Chapter 6: Finding Conversations**

* Drumming up conversations from cold leads is hard. 
* The goal of cold conversations is to stop having them. 
* Cold calling
    * Rejection rate is irrelevant. 
    * You only need one yes to get you started. 
    * Beyond hard hustle, you need to be open to serendipity. 
* **Bringing them to you**: bringing people to you also makes them take you more seriously and want to help you more. How can you plant a flag your customers can see? What can you offer them that will make them want to talk to you?
    * The best leads are inbound. 
* Ways to find conversations
    * Going to them 
    * Cold calls
    * Seizing serendipity
    * Finding a good excuse
    * Immerse yourself in where they are
    * Landing pages (bringing them to you)
    * Organize meetups
        * Rapid way to build credibility in an industry 
    * Speaking and Teaching
    * Industry blogging
* **Warm intros are the goal.**
* Kevin Bacon - the seven degrees of separation. 
* Types of people to reach out to
    * Industry Advisors
    * Universities
    * Investors (Top tier investors are awesome for B2B intros)
* **Email Template**
    * **Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask**
    * **V**ery **F**ew **W**izards **P**roperly **A**sk for help!
* You set the agenda, framing, and tone. 
* Spend energy finding clever ways to generate warm intros instead. **You want to be the _type_ of company that gets inbound from customers and investors.**
* You get more data from in person meetings. 
* Don’t go into the conversations looking for customers - it creates a needy vibe and forfeits the position of power. 
* The way to overcome difficult situations isn’t to power through, but rather to change your circumstances to require less willpower. 
* Keep talking to people until you stop hearing new information - i.e. strive for **thematic saturation**.

**Chapter 7: Choosing Your Customers**

* Incredibly important to segment customers and prioritize. 

> Startups typically don’t starve, they drown. You never have too few ideas, leads, or options, you have too many. You get overwhelmed. You do a little bit of everything. When it comes to getting above water and ,making faster progress, good customer segmentation is your best friend.

* If your startup is too generic - everything gets watered down. 
* Talking to multiple segments in the same problem space has the following problems:
    * You get overwhelmed by options and don’t know where to start
    * You aren’t moving forward but can’t prove yourself wrong
    * You receive mixed feedback and can’t make sense of it
* E.g. all in one nutrition pill - for babies or for bodybuilders?
* Avoid dealing with unfalsifiable hypotheses. 
* Getting specific about your customers allows you to filter out all the noise which comes from everyone else
* Know the difference between 20 conversations with your customers vs 1 conversation with 20 customers. 
    * Can spot this when receiving inconsistent feedback. 
    * In this case, **experts** are usually super helpful. They provide a taxonomy of the industry. 
* If customer feedback is all over the map, you cant extract value. Once you get specific, you can learn. 
* Learning will go faster if we choose respondents on the following criteria:
    * Reachability - who can we get to easily?
    * Profitable - who has money?
    * Personally rewarding - for us as well as for them. 
* Good customer segments are **who-where** pairs
* Common traps you’re talking to the wrong people
    * You have too broad of a segment and are talking to everyone
    * You have multiple customer segments and missed some of them
    * You are selling to businesses with a complicated buying process and have overlooked some of the stakeholders
* You want to talk to people who are representative of your customers, not the ones who sound impressive on your status report. 

**Chapter 8: Running the Process**

* Even if you do everything right, you can get bad results if you have bad process wrapped around your conversations.
* Telling the team “what I learned” is functionally equivalent to telling them “what you’ll do”
    * Problem managerially
    * But also a problem because it’s easy to misinterpret what the customer has said
* Learning bottlenecks can come from two ends
    * Founder in touch with customers can do a bad job of sharing it 
    * Product teams can refuse to engage with the customers and what they say
* Symptoms of a learning bottleneck
    * _You just worry about the product. I’ll handle the customers._
    * _Because the customers told me so!_
    * _I don’t have time to talk to people - I need to be coding!_
* Avoiding bottlenecks is a **three step process:**
  * **1. Prepping**
  * **2. Reviewing**
  * **3. Taking good notes**
* It’s easier to guide the conversation and keep conversation on track if you have an existing set of beliefs that need constant updating. 
* If questions can be answered with some quick desk research - do it. 
* Sit down with the founding team when you prep. If you leave part of the company out of prep, then you end up missing their concerns in the customer conversations. 
* **DO the diligence on the internet, linkedin, and the company website**
* **IF you don’t know what you’re trying to learn - you shouldn’t bother having the conversation.**
* **Always takes notes + code your qualitative data**
* Reviewing
    * After a conversation, share notes with the team.
    * Talk through key quotes and main takeaways from the conversation + any probem you ran into. 
    * Which questions worked and which did not? How can we do better next time?
    * You have to actively practice to get better - a valuable skill for the team. 
    * For remote teams: there’s an open chat window of customer conversations to learn from and track. 
* Meetings - usually 2 people - one to lead the interview the other to take notes. 
* Focus on understanding the process and getting better
* The importance of taking notes
    * Make knowledge searchable 
    * Makes it harder to lie to yourself
    * Can return to notes when looking for new direction
* Coding data
    * any strong emotion is worth writing down. 
        * 😀excited
        * 🙁 angry
        * 😐embrassed
    * Their life
        * ▶️ pain or problem
        * 🥅 goal
        * 🛑 obstacle
        * ⛑️ workaround etc
* Can use different emojis/codes -but it’s important to code the data. 
* Pains an obstacles carry more weight when someone is embarrassed or angry about them. 
* Money signals are also key:
    * ✅feature request or purchasing criteria
    * $ money or budgets or purchasing proess
    * 👻 specific person or company
    * ⭐follow up task
* Take customer notes so that they are:
    * Able to be sorted, mixed, and rearranged
    * Able to be combined with the notes to the rest of your team
    * Permanent and retrievable 
    * Not mixed in with other random noise like to do lists and ideas. 

**The Process**

* **Warnings signs you’re just going through the motions**
    * You're talking more than they are
    * They are complementing you or your idea
    * You told them about your idea and don’t have next steps 
    * You don't have notes
    * You haven't looked through your notes with your team
    * You got an unexpected answer and it didn't change your idea 
    * You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked
    * You aren’t sure what you’re trying to learn in this conversation 
* **Before a batch of conversations**
    * Choose a focused, findeable segment 
    * With your team, decide 3 big learning goals
    * If relevant, deicide on ideal next steps and commitments
    * If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to
    * Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about
    * If a question can be answered via desk research, do that first
* **During the conversation**
    * Frame the conversation
    * Keep it casual 
    * Ask good questions
    * Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals 
    * Take good notes
    * If relevant, press for commitment and next steps
* **After a batch of conversations**
    * With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes
    * If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage
    * Update your beliefs and plan
    * Decide on the next 3 big questions

**Goal of The Process**

1. **Ensure you’re spending time well by attacking the questions which matter, and making use of the brains of the whole founding team.**
2. **To spread new learning to your team as quickly and completely as possible.**

Remember not to worry too much, eternity will forgive.

**Note on Speed**

* Don’t spend a week prepping for meetings. Spend an hour and then go talk to people. Anything more is stalling.
* Don’t spend months doing full time customer conversations before beginning to move on a product. Spend a week, maybe two. Get your bearings and then give them something to commit to.

**Hacking It**

[The Gordian Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot) - In ancient times it was prophesied that whoever undid the convoluted Gordian Knot would rule the land. Coming across the knot, Alexander drew his sword with a single stroke, cutting it in half. The knot was undone and he became “the Great”.

There’s no “right way”. There’s the way that works and the way that doesn’t. 

**Asking for the meeting:**

* **Vision** - sentence on how we’re making the world better
* **Framing** - where you’re at and what you’re looking for
* **Weakness** - where you’re stuck and how you can be helped
* **Pedestal** - show that they in particular can provide that help
* **Ask** - ask for help 
* _What do we want to learn from these guys?_
